Why sequel? Well, [I did have a free domain before](/2021/11/14/new-website), but it had issues with GitHub HTTPS, so I decided to use just github.io.

But now I have a real website now. Announcing... https://yell0wsuit.page

Thanks to GitHub I managed to have my own HTML5 games collection, but with my own domain I have much more freedom now. Utilizing CloudFlare's cache and speed tweaks, my website is much more faster than ever. With increased storage I can upload more games now, on GitHub there's a limit of 5GB and generally a large repository definitely attracts their attentions.

But my effort alone is not enough, I have to pay the hosting fee so I can host HTML5 games for free. I do not run ads on my websites, so it would be nice if you guys help me too (currently there's none :( ).

I have a [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/yell0wsuit), and also [a brand new Patreon page](http://patreon.com/yell0wsuit) in case you don't have a Ko-fi account. For \$5/month tier I will add your name as special thanks in my website. With your effort together we can keep the website alive! I will think of more tier soon.
