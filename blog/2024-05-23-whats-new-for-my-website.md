### Website updates

- Centered the search box, download and import buttons.
- Added the gap between the download and import buttons for small screens.
- Added a loading overlay when loading the game page. This will better communicate to you that the page is still loading.
  - Previously, the page finished loading but the game list was blank with 0 game.
- Excluded some unnecessary data from importing/downloading. This makes the zip file smaller.
- Fixed the Java 2 ME link.
- Fixed missing progress bar for downloading/exporting game save data.
- Add a link to this page :).

### Game updates

- Added: *Like a King!*, *Vivaldia 2*
