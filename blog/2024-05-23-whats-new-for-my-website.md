### Website updates

- Revamped the website theme. Now using *Tailwind CSS* and *shadcn/ui* for styling.
- Optimized the code to make the website load faster than ever.
- Revised the privacy policy to be more transparent.
- Removed the *Java 2 ME* from the game list. Since the web emulation of J2ME was abandoned by Mozilla in 2018, there is no reason to keep it up with broken, unfinished code that will never be fixed. It's recommended to use fully-fledged emulators on Windows or Android instead. [Visit here to find out list of recommended emulators](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Cellphone_emulators#Java_2_Micro_Edition_.28J2ME.29).
  - My personal favorite is *KEmulator nnmod* on Windows.

### Website updates

- Centered the search box, download and import buttons.
- Added the gap between the download and import buttons for small screens.
- Added a loading overlay when loading the game page. This will better communicate to you that the page is still loading.
  - Previously, the page finished loading but the game list was blank with 0 game.
- Excluded some unnecessary data from importing/downloading. This makes the zip file smaller.
- Fixed the Java 2 ME link.
- Fixed missing progress bar for downloading/exporting game save data.
- Add a link to this page :).

### Game updates

- Added: *Like a King!*, *Vivaldia 2*
