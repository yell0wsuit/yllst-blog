Hello. Just a quick update on the "New game" category of my blog.

I've decided to stop writing blog posts every time I add new games to my site, because I find it tedious. Instead, I've written the code that automatically updates the date whenever I upload a new game (you can see it at the "Last updated" part right under the page name), which I think is much more convenient. In addition, there is a new tab called "New & Updated" too, so you can see which new games are added.

Anyways, thanks for reading the new game announcement on my blog over the time! I really appreciate it.
